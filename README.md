# Virtual Mouse Control System

## Project Overview
The Virtual Mouse Control System is a Java-based application that enables users to control mouse operations using hand gestures or virtual input mechanisms. The system replaces traditional physical mouse interaction by providing touchless control, improving accessibility and user convenience.

The application demonstrates human-computer interaction concepts by enabling gesture-based cursor movement and system control.
